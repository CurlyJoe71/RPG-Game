# RPG-Game

This is a fun RPG-style game that I used to exercise my jQuery skills, and CSS animation skills.

You play by first clicking on the character who will serve as your 'hero'. Then select your first 'enemy'. 

You will click attack and notice the damage each character will inflict on the other. Only hero's attack power will increase with each click. The challenge will be in finding the best order in which to battle the characters against each other.

Enjoy!
